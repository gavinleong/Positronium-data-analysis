# Positronium-data-analysis
Data analysis using Python

Python script for performing least-squares regression fit using, at its core, SciPy: scipy.optimize.curve_fit. We used it to extract and analyse binned spectroscopic lifetime data for positronium and positrons from background. The fit was based on a theoretical model for the lifetime of positrium and positrons in CO2 gas.
